Below is a fully developed Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm. This implementation addresses common issues and ensures lists are sorted correctly. 

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Perform merge sort on a list.

    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted
    :return: A new list with elements sorted
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Divide the array into two halves
    middle = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:middle]
    right_half = arr[middle:]

    # Recursively sort both halves
    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)

    # Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)

def merge(left, right):
    """
    Merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

    :param left: Sorted left list
    :param right: Sorted right list
    :return: Merged sorted list
    """
    sorted_list = []
    left_index, right_index = 0, 0

    # Compare elements from both lists and merge
    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
            sorted_list.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            sorted_list.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from the left or right list
    sorted_list.extend(left[left_index:])
    sorted_list.extend(right[right_index:])

    return sorted_list

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_list = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
    sorted_list = merge_sort(example_list)
    print("Sorted list:", sorted_list)
```

### Explanation
- The `merge_sort` function is defined to recursively split the list into halves until each sublist contains a single element. Sub-arrays are then merged using the `merge` function in a sorted manner.
- The `merge` function compares elements of the sublists and appends them into a new list in sorted order. The indices are managed to efficiently merge the remaining elements after initial comparisons.

### Fixed Known Issues
- Properly handling edge cases where elements are already sorted or when input comprises one or zero elements.
- The merge process is correctly implemented to ensure complete coverage of remaining elements in either sub-array after all comparisons have been made, preventing loss of data or incorrect sorting.

This implementation is optimized for sorting and handles potential issues that might have previously caused incorrect sorting.
