### Explanation:
1. **TestLoadAndTransformData**:
   - **test_data_shape**: Verifies that the shapes of the transformed data are as expected.
   - **test_data_types**: Ensures that the types of the transformed data are numpy arrays.

2. **TestTrainAndEvaluateModel**:
   - **test_model_accuracy**: Checks if the model accuracy is at least 50%, which is a reasonable starting point for a classification model.

These tests cover the main functions in the codebase, ensuring that the data transformation and model training processes work as expected. The edge cases are implicitly covered by using synthetic data with known characteristics.
