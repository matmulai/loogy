To write unit tests for `{topic}`, it's crucial to have the specifics of the topic, including the functionality of the codebase it's referring to. Typically, unit tests are written to test individual functions and methods within a codebase to ensure they work as expected. Here's a generic guideline and example of how these tests might be structured if you replace `{topic}` with something specific and have access to the codebase you wish to test:

1. **Identify Functions/Methods**: Start by identifying all the functions and methods within the codebase related to `{topic}`. Make a list of them.

2. **Write Unit Tests**: For each function/method, write tests that cover:
   - Normal cases: where the function/method is expected to behave as intended.
   - Edge cases: unusual inputs where the behavior might differ.
   - Error cases: to ensure that the function/method gracefully handles unexpected inputs or states.

3. **Choose a Testing Framework**: Depending on the language, choose a testing framework, such as JUnit for Java, PyTest for Python, or Jest for JavaScript.

Example if `{topic}` was a Calculator:
```python
# Example for Python with a Calculator class

import unittest
from calculator import Calculator  # Assuming Calculator is your class with add, subtract methods

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.calc = Calculator()

    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(-1, -1), -2)
    
    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.subtract(10, 5), 5)
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.subtract(-1, 1), -2)
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.subtract(-1, -1), 0)

    def test_edge_cases(self):
        self.assertRaises(TypeError, self.calc.add, "a", "b")
        self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: self.calc.divide(1, 0))  # if such a method exists

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Replace the placeholder logic according to the specifics of `{topic}` and your actual codebase. Ensure your tests reflect your exact requirements for complete unit test coverage.
